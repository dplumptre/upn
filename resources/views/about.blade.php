The Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) is a political party that was dominant in western Nigeria during the second republic (1978-1983). The party revolved around the political leadership of Obafemi Awolowo, a sometimes-polemical politician but effective administrator. However, the party's main difference with its competitors is not the leader but the ideals of a social democracy it was founded on. The UPN inherited its ideology from the old Action Group and sees itself as a party for everyone. It is the only party to promote free education and called itself a welfarist party.
The party is currently headed by Professor Bankole Okuwa who is the National Chairman. And Alhaji Abubakar Abdullahi Sokoto who is the National Secretary of the Party. 
The Party’s motto is People’s First. The party believes that Nigerians should be considered first in all its actions.  </p>
<p>Some of the Party’s views include: </p>

<ul>
<li>The party supports a 30-40% revenue allocation for the Federal Government, 40-50% for the states and 10% for the local government is debates centring on the intractable revenue allocation mechanism in Nigeria. Also, what is regarded as restricting today. </li>
<li>Free education for all</li>
<li>Free Medical Care, for the young and aged</li>
<li>Employment for all Nigerians</li>
<li>Integrated rural and urban development</li>
<li>Progressive programs for the development of roads and schools</li>
